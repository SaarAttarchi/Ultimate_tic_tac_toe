## Ultimate tic tac toe 
This is a web-based self made project i worked on to challenge myself and apply the skills I learned in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. 
This game is my implementation of a more advance and startigic version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.

## Game Description
Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3x3 grid, where each cell is itself a smaller Tic Tac Toe board. 
The twist is each move you make determines where your opponent must play next!

### Rules:
- The main game board consists of 9 smaller Tic Tac Toe boards arranged in a 3x3 grid layout.
- When a player makes a move in a small board, their opponent must make their next move in the corresponding part of the main board.
- If the corresponding board is already won or full, the next player can play in any available board.
- The goal is to win 3 connected boards (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the main board.

## Built With

- **HTML** – Structure of the game.
- **CSS** – Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** – Game logic and user interactions.
